# open-datasets
A series of open dataset for SQL practice


##Currently available files: 

A sql script containing tables for HR data (employee, learning and training, benefits, payroll, etc.) and Inventory Management. If you are coming from my OOP Bootcamp blog posts, here are the steps for install: 

1. Install MySQL or MariaDB and set it up for a local environment (unless you plan on running it on a separate computer/server and accessing it that way, then set it up that way)
2. Either execute the SQL script manually, or in Dbeaver or some other DBMS go ahead and execute it through their service.

NOTE: I don't have dummy data set up quite yet and the HR schema script is a bit messed up, so if you feel any need or desire to modify the schema: fork, edit, then send out a pull request. I'm always happy to take the experience and advice of others.
